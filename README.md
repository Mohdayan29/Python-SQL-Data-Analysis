# Airlines Data Analysis Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze airline data to identify opportunities for increasing the occupancy rate of low-performing flights, ultimately leading to enhanced profitability for the airline.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis using SQL and Python, focusing on various aspects of airline operations. The analysis includes data extraction, cleaning, and exploration, followed by in-depth investigations into ticket sales, aircraft performance, and occupancy rates.

## Key Features
- **Database Connection**: Establishes a connection to an SQLite database containing airline data.
- **Data Exploration**: Extracts and visualizes data from multiple tables, including aircraft, airports, bookings, and flights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Checks for and handles missing values across all tables.
- **Basic Analysis**:
  - Counts aircraft with more than 100 seats.
  - Analyzes ticket bookings and total revenue over time.
  - Computes average charges for each aircraft based on fare conditions.
- **Occupancy Rate Analysis**:
  - Calculates total revenue per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft.
  - Evaluates the average occupancy rate and potential revenue increases with improved occupancy.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis.
- **SQLite**: Database management system used for data storage.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Output
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Data Analysis - Airlines.ipynb`) detailing the analysis process and findings, along with a PDF report summarizing the results.
